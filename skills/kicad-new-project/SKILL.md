name: kicad-new-project
description: "Create a new KiCad 10 project without opening KiCad, using the scripts in kicad-schematic and kicad-board-edit: schematic and board files, layer count, thickness, design rules and net classes, rounded outline, mounting holes, parts from the schematic, ground pours, libraries, jobsets and .gitignore. Use when the user wants a new board, a new revision of an existing one, or a PCB for a schematic that doesn't have one yet."

# Start a new project

`KPY` is KiCad's bundled Python, and `board.py` is in `kicad-board-edit`'s folder (see that skill). `sch.py` is in
`kicad-schematic`'s folder.

Get these from the user or the design notes:
- **Board:** size and shape, and what fixes them (the enclosure, holes, edge connectors).
- **Layers and thickness.**
- **Fab and assembly:** which fab, and hand or machine assembly. The bundled rules, jobsets and fab checks are JLC's;
  for another fab, set its minimums with `set_rules()` and pass its rule files to `check.py --rules-dir` (named
  like the bundled ones; see `kicad-check`).

## Steps

The project name is the shared stem of the `.kicad_pro`, `.kicad_sch` and `.kicad_pcb` files.

1. **Board, project and outline:**

   ```bash
   "$KPY" -I <board-edit dir>/board.py new <dir>/<name>.kicad_pcb 50 30 --holes M3
   ```

   This writes the board with a rounded 50 × 30 mm outline at (100, 100), four M3 holes 3 mm in from the corners
   (board-only, so parity ignores them), and a default `.kicad_pro`. For 4 layers or another thickness, call
   `new_board(path, w, h, layers=4, thickness=1.6, holes="M2.5")` from a script. KiCad 10.0's Python can't edit
   the stackup table, so record JLC's stackup choice (made on the order page) in the design notes.

2. **Rules and net classes:**

   ```bash
   "$KPY" -I <board-edit dir>/board.py rules <dir>/<name>.kicad_pro --power +5V,+3V3,GND --power-width 0.5
   ```

   This sets minimums at or above JLC's limits, a 0.2/0.25 mm Default class, and a Power class (all arguments of
   `set_rules()`). For other classes, call `set_rules(pro, classes={...})`. See `kicad-routing` for widths, and
   for `.kicad_dru` rules (DRC doesn't enforce class widths by itself).

3. **Schematic:** `Schematic.new("<dir>/<name>.kicad_sch", title=..., date=...)`, then draw it with
   `kicad-schematic`. ERC must be clean before the next step.

4. **Parts onto the board:** run `"$KPY" -I <board-edit dir>/board.py sync <dir>/<name>.kicad_pcb`. It adds every
   part, with its nets, in a row below the outline.

5. **Place, pour and route:**
   - Place the parts (`kicad-placement`).
   - Route (`kicad-routing`), with the pours (`b.zone("GND", ["F.Cu", "B.Cu"])`) at the end of the routing script,
     which starts with `remove_zones()`. A pour needs its net on the board, so this comes after sync.
   - Check (`kicad-check`).

For a new revision, copy the whole old folder (e.g. `rev1/` to `rev2/`). Library paths that use `${KIPRJMOD}/..` keep
working as long as the folder depth stays the same.

## Libraries

Stock libraries come from the global tables. Add project tables only for the project's own libraries:

```
(fp_lib_table
  (version 7)
  (lib (name "MyProject")(type "KiCad")(uri "${KIPRJMOD}/MyProject.pretty")(options "")(descr "Project footprints"))
)
```

`sym-lib-table` uses the same format, with `sym_lib_table` and a `.kicad_sym` file. Both scripts read the project's
tables first. To make the parts themselves, see `kicad-library`.

## Mechanical choices

- **Holes:** 2.7 mm for M2.5 and 3.2 mm for M3. Use a `_Pad` variant on GND if the chassis should be grounded
  (`b.add_footprint("H1", "MountingHole:MountingHole_3.2mm_M3_Pad", x, y)`).
- **Odd shapes:** for anything other than a rounded rectangle, draw segments and arcs on Edge.Cuts. The outline must
  close exactly, or DRC reports `invalid_outline`.

## Housekeeping

- **`.gitignore`:** `*.kicad_prl`, `~*.lck`, `.history/`, `*-backups/`, `fp-info-cache`.
- **Jobsets:** copy in `jlc-fab.kicad_jobset`, plus `jlc-assembly.kicad_jobset` if JLC assembles the board. Set the zip
  name.
- **`DESIGN.md`:** the board's purpose, supplies, what each connector can see, layers, stackup and fab, and the
  decisions the user accepted, with reasons. Other skills read it.
- **Test plan:** start one with `kicad-bringup` once the schematic settles.
- **CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md:** if the project has one, note the skills it uses and the `KPY` path.
