description: "See a KiCad 10 schematic or PCB with view.py (this skill's folder): KiCad's own plots cropped to the parts you name, each pin's net from KiCad's netlist, a 3D render, and a comparison of two git revisions. Use whenever you need to look at a design, before and after any edit, to check a connection, to review what a commit changed, or when the user asks to see or screenshot a board or schematic."

# Look at a KiCad design

`view.py` (this skill's folder) runs `kicad-cli` and `pdftoppm` with plain `python3`. Write its output to `<scratch>`,
never into the project, and open the PNGs to look at them.

```bash
V=<skill dir>/view.py
python3 $V sch board.kicad_sch -o <scratch>/sheet.png                    # whole sheet
python3 $V sch board.kicad_sch -o <scratch>/u2.png --around U2,C3       # zoomed to these symbols
python3 $V sch board.kicad_sch -o <scratch>/a.png --zoom 120,30,80,60   # window x,y,w,h (sheet mm); --page N
python3 $V pcb board.kicad_pcb -o <scratch>/top.png                     # whole board, F.Cu + silk + outline
python3 $V pcb board.kicad_pcb -o <scratch>/u2.png --around U2 --layers F.Cu,F.SilkS,F.CrtYd,Edge.Cuts
python3 $V pcb board.kicad_pcb -o <scratch>/bot.png --back              # bottom, seen from below (mirrored)
python3 $V pins board.kicad_sch U2 R3                                    # each pin's net
python3 $V net board.kicad_sch /I2C_SDA                                  # every pin on a net
```

`--dpi` and `--margin` adjust the crops. `kicad-cli` is found at its usual place on macOS and Windows, or on `PATH`,
or from `$KICAD_CLI`.

- **Connections come from the netlist, not the picture.** A wire that looks connected but isn't shows up as its own net:
  a missing junction, a label one character off, or an end one grid step away. Unnamed nets read `Net-(C2-Pad2)`;
  unconnected pins read `unconnected-(U1-NC-Pad5)`. Names escape `/` as `{slash}`.
- **Pictures are for spotting problems.** Take numbers from the files or from `board.py pads`.
- **Overlap:** judge text overlap only from a zoomed crop. A whole sheet is too small.
- **Layers:** use canonical names (`F.SilkS`, `F.CrtYd`, `In1.Cu`). One copper layer per picture, since a bottom pour
  hides top tracks.

## 3D render

`K` is `kicad-cli`: `/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/MacOS/kicad-cli` on macOS,
`C:\Program Files\KiCad\10.0\bin\kicad-cli.exe` on Windows, `kicad-cli` on Linux.

```bash
"$K" pcb render -o <scratch>/3d.png --side top --quality basic --width 1600 --height 1000 board.kicad_pcb
```

Add `--zoom 4 --pan "X,Y,0"` for a close-up (aim by trial), and `--side bottom`, `--perspective` or `--rotate` for
other views. Parts without a 3D model (some sensors) show only their pads.

## Compare two revisions

```bash
mkdir -p <scratch>/old <scratch>/new
git archive <old-rev> | tar -x -C <scratch>/old       # or use the working tree as "new"
git archive <new-rev> | tar -x -C <scratch>/new
for t in old new; do python3 $V pins <scratch>/$t/board.kicad_sch $(grep -o '(reference "[^#"]*"' <scratch>/$t/board.kicad_sch | cut -d'"' -f2 | sort -u) > <scratch>/$t.tsv; done
diff <scratch>/old.tsv <scratch>/new.tsv
```

- **Changed lines** are pins whose net changed.
- **Auto-named nets** (`Net-(...)`) rename when their namesake part changes. Check them, but they aren't
  necessarily changes.
- **Values and fields:** diff `"$K" sch export bom --fields 'Reference,Value,Footprint,${DNP}'` from both trees.
- **Pictures:** plot the same area from both trees and compare them side by side.
