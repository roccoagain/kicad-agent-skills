# Route a board

Route by hand, net by net, after placement (`kicad-placement`), with `board.py` (`kicad-board-edit`): `connect`,
`track`, `via`, `gnd_via` and `zone`. Run DRC (printed on every save) until nothing is unconnected.

## Rules and net classes

These live in the `.kicad_pro` JSON; edit it only while the PCB editor is closed.

- **Setting them:** `board.py rules` writes the fab's minimums, the Default class and a Power class;
  `set_rules(pro, classes={...})` adds others. `connect` and `track` take their width from the net's class.
- **Classes:** `net_settings.classes`, each with `name`, `track_width`, `clearance`, `via_diameter`, `via_drill`
  and `priority` (lower wins).
- **Assigning nets:** `net_settings.netclass_patterns` entries such as `{"netclass": "Power", "pattern": "+5V"}`.
  Patterns match the board's net names exactly (`/VBUS`) and accept wildcards (`/USB_D*`).
- **Minimums:** `board.design_settings.rules` (`min_clearance`, `min_track_width`, …), at or above the fab's limits.

DRC enforces a class's clearance but not its track width. Where width matters, add a rule to `<board>.kicad_dru`
(comments on their own lines):

```
(version 1)
(rule "Power track width"
	(condition "A.NetClass == 'Power'")
	(constraint track_width (min 0.5mm)))
```

## Width for current

Outer layers at a 10 °C rise, from IPC-2221 (`I = 0.048 · ΔT^0.44 · A^0.725`, A in mil²):

| Current | 1 oz | 2 oz |
|---|---|---|
| 0.5 A | 0.15 mm | 0.1 mm |
| 1 A | 0.3 mm | 0.15 mm |
| 2 A | 0.8 mm | 0.4 mm |
| 3 A | 1.4 mm | 0.7 mm |
| 5 A | 2.8 mm | 1.4 mm |

- **20 °C rise:** about ⅔ of these widths.
- **Inner layers:** about 2.6× the width at the same copper weight. JLC's inner copper is 0.5 oz, so take about 5×
  the 1 oz column.
- **Voltage drop:** 1 oz copper is about 0.5 mΩ per square (0.3 × 30 mm ≈ 50 mΩ).
- **Vias:** a 0.3 mm drill with standard (about 20 µm) plating carries about 1 A.

## Clearance for voltage

Below 30 V the fab minimum is enough. Above it, IPC-2221 B2 (external, uncoated). The voltages are DC or AC peak:
230 VAC is 325 V peak, the 2.5 mm row.

| Voltage | Clearance |
|---|---|
| 31–150 V | 0.6 mm |
| 151–300 V | 1.25 mm |
| 301–500 V | 2.5 mm |

IPC-2221 is functional spacing only. For mains or anything a user can touch, the safety standard that applies (such as
IEC 62368-1) sets creepage and clearance, usually much larger: ask which. Put those nets in their own class so DRC
enforces the clearance.

## Pours

- **Pad connections:** keep thermal reliefs (the default). A solid connection on one pad of an 0402/0201 tombstones
  it in reflow, and through-hole pads tied solid to a pour are hard to hand-solder, which is how JLC fits through-hole
  parts. `zone(..., pads="solid")` suits a pour that only meets exposed or power pads. A "starved thermal" error on
  a pad boxed in by tracks: connect it with a track or a via.
- **Boxed-in pads:** a pour only reaches a pad through a gap at least its minimum width; a ground pad hemmed in by
  tracks stays unconnected even when poured solid (DRC lists it). Give each SMD ground pad its own `gnd_via()` to
  the other layer's pour as you route, rather than relying on the top pour.
- **Dead copper:** keep island removal on (`island_removal_mode 0`).
- **After filling,** look at each copper layer (`view.py pcb --layers B.Cu`): a route can pass DRC and still cut a
  pour into islands or leave a fast signal without ground under it.

## Differential pairs and impedance

- **Width and gap:** from the fab's impedance calculator for the stackup you will order (JLC has one).
- **2-layer 1.6 mm boards:** with the reference plane about 1.5 mm below, a 90 Ω microstrip pair is impractically
  wide; route it as coplanar waveguide with ground (CPWG) instead. USB full-speed only needs short and matched; short
  USB 2.0 high-speed runs work as CPWG; longer or faster links want 4 layers.
- **Length:** compare a pair by summing `t.GetLength()` (mm via `pcbnew.ToMM`) over each net's tracks, in KiCad's
  Python. Via barrels aren't included.
- **Nearby pour** lowers impedance: keep it at least twice the dielectric height away (about 3 mm on a 1.6 mm 2-layer
  board), or design the line as CPWG with that pour as part of it.
- **Reference copper:** no fast signal may cross a gap or slot in the ground under it. DRC can't see this; look at the
  other layer with `view.py` along each fast net.

## Pin swaps

If two nets cross only because of their pin assignment, swap interchangeable pins (op-amp or gate inputs, identical
units, same-function GPIOs, order-free connector pins). Confirm in the datasheet, change the schematic first, then
`board.py sync`, and report each swap.

## Doing it with board.py

1. **Plan from numbers.** `board.py pads` gives every pad's centre, size and net. Centreline to the edge of other
   copper: the clearance plus half the track width. Centreline to centreline of two tracks: the clearance plus half
   of each width.
2. **One routing script**, in a fresh process after placement: `connect` pad to pad (adding waypoints where the path
   must turn), `track` where every corner matters, vias where a net changes layer, `zone(...)` last.
3. **Iterate on the script, not the board:** start it with `remove_tracks(nets=["*"]); remove_zones()`, so a rerun
   replaces the whole route, and end it with `save(dry_run=True)` until DRC is clean, then `save()`. To route only
   new parts on a finished board, start with `remove_tracks(refs=[...])` for those parts instead, so a rerun
   doesn't duplicate vias or wipe the rest. Moving a part
   a few tenths of a mm often beats contorting a track: change the placement script and rerun both.
4. **Record** in the design notes any constraint a later change must respect.

Done when DRC reports no errors, no unconnected items and no parity issues.
